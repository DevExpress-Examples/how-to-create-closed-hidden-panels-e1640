# How to: Create Closed (Hidden) Panels


<p>The following example shows how to create closed (hidden) panels. To create closed panels, panel objects are added to the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfDockingDockLayoutManager_ClosedPanelstopic">DockLayoutManager.ClosedPanels</a> collection.</p>
<p>In the example, the built-in Closed Panels bar is visible (the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfDockingDockLayoutManager_ClosedPanelsBarVisibilitytopic">DockLayoutManager.ClosedPanelsBarVisibility</a> property is set to Auto). It allows closed panels to be restored on the fly.</p>
